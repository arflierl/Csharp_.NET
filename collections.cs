The Contains method searches for an item in a list
note when making a list of strings, it might be
wise to use ToUpper or ToLower when adding strings to the list
and then doing the same for searching with the Contains method
to avoid confusion about capitalization, or for instance
having multiple usernames which are the same

Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fâ‚™, form a sequence, the Fibonacci sequence, 
in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. 
The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, 
although some authors omit the initial terms and start the sequence from 1 and 1 or from 1 and 2. 
However, I think it should start from 0 and 1

/*
we use dynamic programming instead of straight recursion,
because even though there is an obvious mathematical
recurrence relation, we are wasting a lot of time with repeated
calls for the same inputs.  Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. 
Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. 
This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
